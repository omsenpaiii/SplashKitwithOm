    TASK 3 OF WEEK 2:
</h4>
<div>
    The basic goal for this task is to create a custom header program.
    <br>
    To create a custom header program in C++, you should have a solid understanding of the C++ programming language,
    including data types, control structures, and functions. You should also be familiar with the concept of header
    files and how they are used to organize and reuse code. Additionally, it would be helpful to have experience with
    file input/output and string manipulation.

<h4>
    <br>
    TASK 1 AND 2 OF WEEK 3:
</h4>
<div>
    The basic goal for this task is to extend the program done in Hellouser1.
    <br>
    You must have an understanding of functions as you are required to make your own functions in this task.
    For this task, you must have an understanding of creating functions like read_string, read_integer and most
    importantly read_double as it is the required need for this task.
    For eg, you can do the required changes in the following read_integer code to convert it into read_double.
</div>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">
    double read_integer(string prompt)
    {
        string line;
        line = read_string(prompt);
        return convert_to_integer(line);
    }
</code></pre>
<br>
<div>
    You must have knowledge of data types and declaring variables.
    <br>
    Also, don't forget to learn about hand executions for the program flow.
</div>
